        <h2>About Us</h2>
        
        <p class="about-paragraph">Atlas Strategies and Marketing was created to link small business owners with new and diverse demographics. 
            We strive to educate our clients on the new era of digital marketing. 
            </p> 
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

        <p class="about-paragraph">Our Main goals include building an online domain/storefront for your business that is inexpensive to 
            start/maintain. We also can help our less tech-savvy clients be prepared to run these sites after our services end. We also 
            work with our clients to maximize social media accounts and turn those social media viewers into clients. We use our version of 
            the C.A.S.E Funnel for lead generation, nurturing, and conversion. We also specialize in gaining new demographics of customers and 
            building/fostering communities around the respective business. Lastly, we are emerging pioneers in SEO, a new problem plaguing small 
            businesses' effectiveness online.

                <h2>Building A Client Funnel</h2>
                <p >Our goal with the client funnel is to optimize all aspects of your business to bring in as many new clients as possible. 
                    We do this through our version of the C.A.S.E funnel. This funnel aims to maximize lead generation, lead nurturing and most importantly 
                    lead conversion. This method is easy for anyone to learn and is designed to be adjustable based on your business and its needs.

                    be tailored to pull in customers in all stages of the buying process and be able to service them all through information provided 
                    on the site. i.e. services outline articles and blog posts. Also through a live chat to curate hot leads at any time and lastly 
                    through an online storefront specially made for your product or service.

                <h2>Building a Newsletter </h2>
                <p >This goal is simple yet important. By adding a contact tab on your website and requiring an email you can start to build 
                    an email list of potential buyers who you keep updating on new products and services. Your community can be more in the loop of what your 
                    business is up to day to day. Having a newsletter is also a great way to do this and can also display your knowledge and passion for your business.
